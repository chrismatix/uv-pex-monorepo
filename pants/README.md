# Pants snapshot of the grog demo

This `pants/` directory mirrors the grog example code (server, cli, shared libs, and proto schema) and wires it up with Pants so you can compare the two build systems side‑by‑side.

## How to run Pants

- From this `pants/` directory run `pants --version` (install Pants however you like, e.g. `pipx install pantsbuild.pants`).
- Build pexes: `pants package server:server_bin cli:cli_bin` or just `pants package ::`.
- Run tests: `pants test ::`.
- Docker builds can keep using the existing Dockerfiles; the pex outputs land under `dist/` as `server.pex` and `cli.pex`.

Notes:
- Interpreter is pinned to Python 3.12 to match the grog demo.
- Proto stubs are generated by Pants from `lib/proto/schema/*.proto` into a `pb.*` package, mirroring the `build_proto.sh` script.
- Lockfiles are disabled to keep the demo lightweight; enable them by setting `[python].enable_resolves = true` and running `pants generate-lockfiles`.
